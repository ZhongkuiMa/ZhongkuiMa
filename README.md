# Hey there! I'm Zhongkui Ma (马中奎)~ 👋

I’m a **PhD student** at the **University of Queensland** 🎓, deeply immersed in the fascinating world of **neural networks** 🤖—a constantly evolving field that pushes me to think outside the box every single day!

My research focuses on **neural network verification (NNV)** 🧠💪. I’m passionate about ensuring these powerful models are robust, reliable, and dependable, regardless of the conditions or inputs they encounter.

## Latest GitHub Repos 🔧

I’m currently working on some exciting tools that I’m thrilled to share with you:

- [shapeonnx](https://github.com/ZhongkuiMa/shapeonnx): A tool to **infer the shape of an ONNX model** when the official tool being down. It’s a simple yet powerful tool that helps you understand the dimensions of your model’s inputs and outputs! 📏
- [slimonnx](https://github.com/ZhongkuiMa/slimonnx): A tool to **optimize and simplify your ONNX models** by removing redundant operations and resolving version issues. It makes ONNX files cleaner, more efficient, and ready for action! 🚀
- [torchonnx](https://github.com/ZhongkuiMa/torchonnx): A tool for **converting ONNX models** to **PyTorch models** (.pth for parameters, .py for structure). It’s simple, lightweight, and designed for seamless model conversion 🔄.
- [torchvnnlib](https://github.com/ZhongkuiMa/torchvnnlib): A tool to **convert VNN-LIB files** (.vnnlib) to **PyTorch tensors** (.pth files) for efficient neural network verification. Take full advantage of the PyTorch ecosystem! 🚀
- [propdag](https://github.com/ZhongkuiMa/propdag): A **bound propagation framework** for **neural network verification**. It supports any **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** structure, covering both **feedforward** and **backward** propagation patterns for verification. This tool allows researchers to focus on their algorithms without worrying about complex computation graphs! 💪

# Hey there! I'm Zhongkui Ma (马中奎)~ 👋

I’m a **PhD student** at the **University of Queensland** 🎓, and I’m **deeply immersed** in the thrilling world of **neural networks** and **AI** 🤖—a world that’s constantly evolving and challenging me to think outside the box every single day!

My research is all about **neural network verification (NNV)** 🧠💪. I’m passionate about ensuring that these powerful models are rock-solid and reliable, no matter what conditions or inputs they face. It’s all about pushing boundaries and making AI safer and more dependable!

Lately, I’ve been working on two super exciting tools that I can't wait to share with you 😊 (I can’t take them as a paper😅):

- **torchonnx**: This tool lets you **convert an ONNX model (.onnx file) to a PyTorch model (.pth for parameters, .py for structure)** 🔄. While `torch.onnx` lets you go from PyTorch to ONNX, **torchonnx** lets you do the reverse! It’s simple, lightweight, and powerful—just what you need for seamless model conversion! 🔥 This project is developing. 🫵
- **slimonnx**: This tool helps you **optimize and simplify your ONNX models** by eliminating redundant operations and tackling version issues! 🚀 ONNX files can get messy, but **slimonnx** will give you a clean, streamlined version that’s lean and mean—ready for action! 💪 This project is developing. 🫵



I also have some projects about several published papers.

# Hey there! I'm Zhongkui Ma (马中奎)~ 👋



I’m a **PhD student** at the **University of Queensland** 🎓, and I’m deeply immersed in the thrilling world of **neural networks** 🤖—a world that’s constantly evolving and challenging me to think outside the box every single day!



My research is all about **neural network verification (NNV)** 🧠💪. I’m passionate about ensuring that these powerful models are rock-solid and reliable, no matter what conditions or inputs they face.

I have had some projects about several published papers.

Lately, I’ve been working on super exciting tools that I can't wait to share with you 😊:

- **torchonnx**: This tool lets you **convert an ONNX model (.onnx file) to a PyTorch model (.pth for parameters, .py for structure)** 🔄. While `torch.onnx` lets you go from PyTorch to ONNX, **torchonnx** lets you do the reverse! It’s simple, lightweight, and powerful—just what you need for seamless model conversion! 🔥 This project is developing. 🫵
- **slimonnx**: This tool helps you **optimize and simplify your ONNX models** by eliminating redundant operations and tackling version issues! 🚀 ONNX files can get messy, but **slimonnx** will give you a clean, streamlined version that’s lean and mean—ready for action! 💪 This project is developing. 🫵
- **torchvnnlib**: This tool is to **convert VNN-LIB (.vnnlib files) to PyTorch tensors (.pth files)** to take the advantage of the PyTorch ecosystem! Accelerate loading the input and output constraints of neural network verification! 🚀 



Thanks so much for visiting my GitHub! Let’s innovate, collaborate, and make AI even better together! ⭐
